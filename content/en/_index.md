# Towards Nature

“We can create beautiful and natural environments with rainwater.”

The passion of Towards Nature Gardener is Permaculture. Through Permaculture and the lifestyle that comes with it, we want to change the world into a nature-friendly, calming, balanced, more meaningful and happy place. In the Permaculture concept, it is all about working together with nature, instead of fighting it. Rain water can be devastating if the environment does not cooperate with it, but if it is collected as nature does, we can create beautiful and naturally balanced environments with rainwater. We participate in the Rainproof network to create awareness and work together with all organizations to transform our cities in this direction.

We live in a changing climate. When we ignore people as being part of this planet with its natural cycles, we experience the result of extreme rain: overflowing streets and houses. Nature does not do that; we are the cause of it ourselves. In order to change that, we have to change our thinking: from nature control to cooperation with nature. We, as a Towards Nature Gardener company, find it important to inspire and spread this philosophy.
