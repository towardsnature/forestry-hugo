# A rain-resistant discovery garden

The Laterna Magica elementary school at IJburg already had a fantastic green schoolyard. 'A discovery garden, with lots of plants and animals, in which nature can get the space,' explains housekeeper Ivo Donkersloot. "Unfortunately, the drainage was not taken into account." The schoolyard runs off towards a canal. Due to the difference in height, 'serious mudflows' arose in heavy rain showers. 'All soil disappeared in the canal. The schoolyard literally washed away. It was a continuous battle against water, mud and sand, 'says Donkersloot.

The primary school switched [Towards Nature Permaculture Gardener](https://www.rainproof.nl/node/737) to make the square green again, and this time also made rainproof. The school used the Amsterdam Impulse School Squares subsidy: a municipal program to make school squares more challenging, greener and rain-resistant. "A tiled schoolyard is cheaper, but then you actually move the problem and your neighbors might get flooding. IJburg is already so fossilized, 'says Donkersloot. "Moreover, we find it important that our schoolyard is a garden for discoveries."

In the new design delivered in March 2017, rainwater can infiltrate much better into the soil. To prevent erosion, the terraces on the slope have been reinforced with brick walls, and a staircase of old car tires. 'With these borders and sheet piles, everything stays in place,' explains Donkersloot.

## Gravel channels

On the slope, 25 fruit trees, fruit bushes, herb plants and flowers that absorb rainwater and hold the ground are now growing. Because of the principle of permaculture, the soil is looser, turned over by insects and worms, and the rainwater absorbs better. The young trees are now better protected with fences around tree mirrors full of wood chips so they get the chance to root well.

The sandbox has been moved to the site of the former outdoor theater on top of the slope. In the rounded and deepened amphitheater, a few centimeters of rainwater regularly remained through a clogged drainage, which was dangerous for the little ones. At the place where the sandbox first lay, there was also a lot of flooding. Actually, it was a kind of mud pool. Now there is tree bark. 'Underneath are channels dug and filled with gravel, which ensures good drainage,' says Donkersloot.

## Playing with rainwater

In the back of the schoolyard, in the lower part, there are raised vegetable garden bins and pens for the rabbits, a chicken and two pigs. In addition, on the former bicycle parking lot, 250 square meters of tiles made way for a play area with willow tunnels and a rainwater pond. Against a shed is a large rainwater tank. The water can flow from here towards the pond. The children use halved rain pipes to steer the water. 'Unfortunately it does not work optimally because the PVC tubes are too light. They do not stay well in place, "says Donkersloot. "We actually need some heavier tubes."

And that is how the schoolyard continues to develop. At the time of the visit, the willow tunnel is also being restored, because it suffered from the ravaging children. 'The water, the wind and the children cause a lot of wear and tear. But that's how we keep busy, 'says Donkersloot.

## Tips from the caretaker

Donkersloot does have some tips for schools that also want to greenen their schoolyard and make it rainproof: 'Pay attention to how the wind sprays the sand when there is a difference in level. Before you know it you have a desert. And think carefully in which directions the water can run away. '
